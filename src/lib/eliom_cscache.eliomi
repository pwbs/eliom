(** Client-server cache for Eliom applications, that is used both for
    keeping data on client side or keeping values in memory during a
    request.  This module hides many subtelties that are useful for
    client-server (possibly reactive) applications, like, for example,
    handling delays correctly both on client and server sides.

(** The type of association tables (implemented using Hashtbl) *)
type ('a, 'b) t

  (** [find cache get_from_db key]
      returns the value associated to [key] in cache.
      If not present, it calls [get_from_db] to fetch the data from
      the database. [get_from_db] must be implemented both server
      and client sides.
      Several simultaneous call to [find] will result in a single call to
      [get_from_db]. Exceptions are not cached.

(** [do_cache cache key value] adds the association from [key] to
    [value] in [cache], or replaces it if not already present.  Called
    from client side, it affects only client side cache.  Called from
    server side, it will have effect both on the server cache (scope:
    request) and the client side cache.  *)
